            <div class="personal-description-content">
              <p>Currently I am a PhD candidate in philosophy at <a href="https://www.uu.nl/en">Utrecht University</a>; my supervisor is Herman Philipse. Before coming to Utrecht, I worked as a consultant for <a href="https://atos.net/en/about-us">Atos Consulting</a>. My undergraduate studies were in Business Management (<a href="https://www.dhbw-stuttgart.de/zielgruppen/international-visitors/overview/">here</a>). During an abroad semester at <a href="https://bond.edu.au/">Bond University</a>, I became interested in philosophy. Back at home, I wrote my BA thesis on corporate social responsibility, together with the <a href="http://www.andretta.de/">company</a> I worked for at the time. The thesis was theoretically sound, but failed to have a practical impact. I decided that I had to learn more about the underpinnings of morality and psychology and went on to pursue a MA in philosophy at <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/">University College London</a>. Naturally, more questions arose on the way. During my time as a consultant, I also started a BSc in Psychology at the <a href="https://www.fernuni-hagen.de/english/">FernUniversity in Hagen</a>. Today, I strive to put my experiences from business management, philosophy, and psychology to work in my research. The evolutionary perspective allows me to get to the heart of the matter: how are our moral thoughts and feelings influenced by our personal and evolutionary history, are these influences problematic, and if so, what can we do about it? I am excited to find out more.
              <br>
              Apart from my research, I am involed in organising conferences (Examples: <a href="http://www.evoethics.com/evolution-and-moral-epistemology-2018.html">here</a>, <a href="http://www.evoethics.com/debunking--disagreement-2017.html">here</a>, <a href="http://dfdop37.weebly.com/">here</a>, or <a href="http://scienceslam-stuttgart.org/">here</a>) and the <a href="http://www.ozsw.nl/organisation/phd-council/">PhD council</a> of the Dutch Research School of Philosophy.

            <h3>A Non-Modal Accounts of Accidentality</h3>
            <p>I am working towards a non-modal account of accidentality, to support a theory of defeat. For reasons I highlight in the article, I believe that such a notion is crucial to make debunking arguments work.</p>

            <h3>Debunking and Disagreement</h3>
            <p>Some argue that evolutionary debunking arguments work only if they reveal a disagreement problem. First, I argue that this is not so. Second, I show that if it were so, then debunking would not pose a problem, because it does not reveal problematic kinds of disagreement.</p>

            <h3>Independence and Objectivity in Ethics</h3>
            <p>Objectivity in ethics is often understood in reference to an independence relation. Roughly, the ethical values are said to be independent of what we humans think about them. I present some counterexamples to this formulation and try to make the notion more precise.</p>

              <h3>Old Wine in New Bottles. Evolutionary Debunking Arguments and the Benacerraf-Field Challenge</h3>
              <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Evolutionary debunking arguments (EDAs) purport to show that robust moral realism, the metaethical view that there are non-natural and mind-independent moral properties and facts that we can know about, is incompatible with evolutionary explanations of morality. One of the most prominent evolutionary debunking arguments is advanced by Sharon Street, who argues that if moral realism were true, then objective moral knowledge is unlikely because realist moral properties are evolutionary irrelevant and moral beliefs about those properties would not be selected for. However, no evolutionary, causal explanation plays an essential role in reaching the argument’s epistemological conclusion. Street’s argument depends on the Benacerraf-Field challenge, which is the challenge to explain the reliability of our moral beliefs about causally inert moral properties. The Benacerraf-Field challenge relies on metaphysically necessary facts about realist moral properties, rather than on contingent Darwinian facts about the origin of our moral beliefs. Attempting to include an essential causal empirical premise yet avoiding recourse to the Benacerraf-Field problem yields an argument that is either self-defeating or of limited scope. Ultimately, evolutionary, causal explanations of our moral beliefs and their consequences do not present the strongest case against robust moral realism. Rather, the question is whether knowledge of casually-inert, mind-intendent properties is plausible at all.</p>

              <h3>Can Moral Realists deflect defeat due to evolutionary explanations of morality?</h3>
              <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> I address Andrew Moon's recent discussion (2016, this journal) of the question whether third-factor accounts are valid responses to debunking arguments against moral realism. Moon argues that third-factor responses are valid under certain conditions but leaves open whether moral realists can use his interpretation of the third-factor response to defuse the evolutionary debunking challenge. I rebut Moon's claim and answer his question. Moon's third-factor reply is valid only if we accept externalism about epistemic defeaters. However, even if we do, I argue, the conditions Moon identifies for a valid third-factor response are not met in the case of moral realism.</p>

              <h3>Measuring Moral Development</h3>
                <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> In the aftermath of the financial crisis, heightened awareness of ethical issues sparked increased efforts within universities and businesses to educate people in moral matters. Sometimes, psychological tests are used to measure whether moral development occurred. If moral development is understood as a synonym of moral progress, then this might seem like a good sign: it seems as if we have a handle on making moral progress. Alas, moral development and moral progress are two very different things. And although we know a lot about moral development, what we know has little to do with moral progress. Let’s untangle both concepts. </p>
